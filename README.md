# Image-Caption-Generator
This is an image captioning system using a VGG16 CNN for feature extraction and an LSTM network for sequence modeling on the Flickr8k dataset on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k). Processed images to extract 4096-dimensional feature vectors from the fc2 layer of VGG16. Preprocessed text captions with tokenization, padding, and vocabulary mapping. Designed and trained an encoder-decoder architecture integrating image features with word embeddings to generate captions. Achieved a BLEU score of 0.54, demonstrating effective and coherent caption generation for diverse images.
